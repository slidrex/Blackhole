  - Hello!
  - Are you ok?
  - I hope you are fine...
  - So...
  - ...
  - Do you see this knight?
  - This little thing is a player that plays your game
  - Who knows what this knight can do...
  - Your main purpose is to make his life better
  - Because you are a game designer
  - Build structures, place mobs and upgrade him
  - Programmers and artists already did their work
  - The rest is up to you
  - Don't leave this knight alone
  - Good luck!
